    "What is Multiprocessing?\n",
    "Multiprocessing is a technique where a program runs multiple processes simultaneously. Each process operates independently and has its own memory space. This contrasts with multithreading, where threads share the same memory space within a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Multiprocessing in Python?\n",
    "Bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents multiple threads from executing Python code simultaneously in a single process, which limits concurrency for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Solution: Multiprocessing creates separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space, allowing true parallelism and efficient use of multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "Isolation and Fault Tolerance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: In a multithreaded environment, a crash or error in one thread can potentially affect others.\n",
    "Solution: Processes are isolated from each other. If one process crashes, it doesn’t affect others, providing better fault tolerance.\n",
    "Effective for CPU-Bound Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: For tasks that require a lot of CPU power (e.g., computations or data processing), multithreading might not be efficient due to the GIL.\n",
    "Solution: Multiprocessing can distribute CPU-bound tasks across multiple processes, each running on a separate CPU core, improving performance.\n",
    "Memory Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Memory leaks or large memory usage in one thread can affect the entire process.\n",
    "Solution: Each process has its own memory space, so memory management issues are confined to that specific process.\n",
    "Example Use Case:\n",
    "Data Processing: If you’re processing large datasets, using multiprocessing can speed up the work by dividing the data into chunks and processing each chunk in a separate process."
